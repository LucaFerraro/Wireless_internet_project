Summing up, in this project we have analyzed some probe captures in order to try to classify traffic at \textit{MAC} layer with 
all the limitations of this way of working.\\ 
The main results we have been able to obtain are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recognition of 4 Sonos devices communicating one with the others via WiFi.
    \item Recognition of 2 multimedia flows, one during a zoom video-conference, the other during a university lecture,
            with the individuation of the devices acting as clients and as servers in the two cases.
    \item Recognition of a situation in which devices are not supposed to be used a lot (launch time) as expected.
\end{itemize}
